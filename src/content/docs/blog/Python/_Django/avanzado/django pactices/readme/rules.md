Instructions
The test consists of a few small to medium questions and a single large task identified as oowlishCustomerApiFilesystem. Make sure to organize yourself accordingly to be able to get to that last one with enough time to resolve it. Notice it is acceptable to only partially finish the last task, in which case you'll still gain points by completing as much of it as you can.

For the free-text questions we expect you to answer with up to 3 paragraphs worth of text.

Good luck and we'll see you on the other side!

Rules
I grant permission to share with Oowlish my results and all associated data.
I will not consult/copy code from any source including a website, book, or friend/colleague to complete the questions, although I may reference language documentation or use an IDE that has code completion features.
I will not copy, reproduce, distribute, or publicly display any of the information I come across during my session, including but not limited to the question descriptions copyrighted by CodeSignal.
